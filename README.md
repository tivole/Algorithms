# Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree

In computer science, <b>Prim's</b> (also known as <b>Jarn√≠k's</b>) algorithm is a <i>greedy algorithm</i> that finds a <i>minimum spanning tree</i> for a <i>weighted undirected graph</i>. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex.
