# Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree

In computer science, <b>Prim's</b> (also known as <b>Jarn√≠k's</b>) algorithm is a <i>greedy algorithm</i> that finds a <i>minimum spanning tree</i> for a <i>weighted undirected graph</i>. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex.

## Description

The algorithm may informally be described as performing the following steps:

1. Initialize a tree with a single vertex, chosen arbitrarily from the graph.
2. Grow the tree by one edge: of the edges that connect the tree to vertices not yet in the tree, find the minimum-weight edge, and transfer it to the tree.
3. Repeat step 2 (until all vertices are in the tree).
